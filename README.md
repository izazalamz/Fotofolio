# üì∏ Fotofolio ‚Äî Photographer Hiring Platform

Fotofolio is a **full-stack web application** where clients can post photography jobs and photographers can apply. Clients then review applications, select a photographer, and lock the booking. The project highlights **DBMS fundamentals** such as queries, joins, transactions, and constraints, with a simple yet professional frontend.

## üìã DBMS Learning Points
- `GET` with filters, pagination, `ORDER BY`  
- `POST` inserts (bookings, applications)

- **Transaction** (select photographer, reject others)  
- **Constraints**: unique app per booking, foreign keys, enums
